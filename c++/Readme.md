The project is organized in two different folders:

-include: It includes all the declarations and the implementation of our class Tree, divided in different files in order to make easy to read and control the code.

-src: it includes two source code with two different main function  (in  the report there are all the particulars).

-Makefile: we use it to create the file.o and the  executable with only the comman "make".
